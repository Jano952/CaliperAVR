# CaliperAVR
This is Caliper readout tool for ATMega8A written in Arduino with absolute minimum parts, only 1x ATMega8A and 1x capacitor for VCC ! No other parts are needed, only UART to USB converter for data reading to PC.
Level shifting is done using internal comparator in AVR, which saves external level shifting circuit.

Connection:     

ADC0 (PC0) pin - Caliper Clock pin

ADC1 (PC1) pin - Caliper Data pin
